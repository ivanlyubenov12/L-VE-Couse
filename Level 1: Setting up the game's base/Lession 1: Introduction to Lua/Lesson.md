# Level 1: Setting Up the Game’s Base

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Lua

Welcome to the beginning of your retro RPG journey! Before we dive into building our game, let’s start with the basics: learning Lua. Lua is a powerful yet lightweight scripting language that’s beginner-friendly and perfect for game development in Love2D. Let’s jump in!

### What is Lua?

Lua is a simple, efficient, and fast programming language often used in games, from small indie projects to massive, complex games. It’s known for its flexibility and ease of embedding, which makes it perfect for scripting game logic.

With Lua, you can:
- Create game logic like character movement, animations, and interactions
- Manage game data efficiently
- Modify and extend games easily

Lua is structured, easy to read, and has a syntax that's beginner-friendly.

### What You’ll Learn in This Lesson
1. **Setting Up a Lua Environment** – Get the basics ready so you can start coding.
2. **Variables and Data Types** – Learn how to store and manipulate data in Lua.
3. **Control Structures** – Dive into if-statements, loops, and functions, which form the backbone of game logic.
4. **Functions and Modules** – Discover how to create and reuse code.

By the end of this lesson, you’ll have a solid foundation in Lua, allowing you to start coding your game.

### Lesson Outline

#### 1. Setting Up the Environment
   - Install Love2D and set up a project folder.
   - Test the setup by running a “Hello World” program in Love2D.
   
#### 2. Lua Basics: Variables and Data Types
   - **Variables**: Learn to create and name them.
   - **Data Types**: Numbers, strings, booleans, tables—everything you need to store data.

#### 3. Control Structures
   - **Conditionals**: Use `if` statements to create decisions.
   - **Loops**: Explore `for` and `while` loops for repeating actions.
   
#### 4. Functions and Modules
   - **Functions**: Wrap code in reusable blocks.
   - **Modules**: Organize code in separate files (useful as your game grows).

### Let’s Get Started!

1. Follow along with the code snippets provided in this folder.
2. Experiment with the examples. Try creating a few variables or a simple loop on your own.
3. Ask questions in the discussions or look up additional resources if you’re curious.

By mastering the basics of Lua in this lesson, you’re laying the foundation for all the incredible features we’ll be adding to our game later on. Every great game starts with a simple script!
